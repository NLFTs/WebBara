title: Indie Game Development Journey
description: Designed and developed a 2D indie game from concept to release, handling gameplay mechanics, level design, and UI systems. Focused on creating engaging player experiences, smooth controls, and optimized performance. The project improved my skills in game logic, asset integration, and player-centered design.
