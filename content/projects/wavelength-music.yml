title: Rhythm Game Development Project
description: Designed and developed a rhythm-based game focused on timing mechanics and engaging audio-visual feedback. Implemented beat-synced gameplay, dynamic UI animations, and responsive controls to create an immersive music-driven experience. This project improved my skills in audio integration, game feel, and interactive design.
